# **Cats vs Dogs Classifier**

## **Project Overview**

##### This project classifies two classes of images which are dogs and cats. We can divide the projects into parts as following :
##### 1.Load the dataset.
##### 2.Preprocessing the data such as : (Rescale , Resize , divide the data into validation and training).
##### 3.build the classifer using keras and TensorFlow .
##### 4.Training the data using classifer.
##### 5.Compare between the models and get the best classifer model.
##### 6.Use the classifer to classify new data.

## **Dataset**

##### The dataset used for training purpose has been used from Kaggle. You can download the dataset from: 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

##### The training folder has 20000 training samples and about 5000 validation samples. 

## **Accuracy**

##### The model has an accuracy of 86% on the training set and 83.68% on the validation set.
