# **Cats vs Dogs Classifier**

## **Project Overview**

### This project classifies two classes of images which are dogs and cats. We can divide the projects into parts as following :
### 1.Load the dataset.
### 2.Preprocessing the data such as : (Rescale , Resize , divide the data into validation and training).
### 3.build the classifer using keras and TensorFlow .
### 4.Training the data using classifer.
### 5.Compare between the models and get the best classifer model.
### 6.Use the classifer to classify new data.

## **Dataset**

### The dataset used for training purpose has been used from Kaggle. You can download the dataset from: 

### The training folder has 20000 training samples and about 5000 validation samples. 

## **Accuracy**

### The model has an accuracy of 86% on the training set and 83.68% on the validation set.
